A hacker can use that date to guess your passwords or even recover your account. In Sri Lanka, many people use their birthdays for passwords or PINs. It’s like giving a thief a clue to your house key. Try to keep such details private — post your celebration photo instead, not your exact date. According to my suggestion, the safer answer is that sharing your date of birth can make it easier for someone to hack your accounts."
